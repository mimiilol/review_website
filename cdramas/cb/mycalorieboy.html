        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This is a story about a group of high school students' friendship and growth. They learned, cried, laughed, and cheered each other on when the going got tough. Growing up in high school, they had to overcome many challenges including learning about real love. After all, what is love in the eyes of 17 year olds?</p>
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>Cried sooo much, didn‚Äôt like the fl at first but now i got over it LMAO. I think it is beautifully written. It has elements of a fluffy romance, but it also shows many heavy topics and some scenes are VERY EMOTIONAL. Tbh it‚Äôs more of a slice of life drama than romance, however the romance scenes are very cute</p>
        <p>Probably my first ever slice of life drama, the characters are amazing and I loved all of their stories. I do wish that they went more into the romance aspect, because it was mainly about the hardships of life. The ending was a little disappointing, I wanted one more episode to show their future together.</p>
