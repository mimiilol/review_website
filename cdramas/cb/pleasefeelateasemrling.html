        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>LOVE IT, Itâ€™s a fluffy romance however near the end when the plot unfolds it becomes more of an action BUT I LOVE IT.  When the plot actually unfolds it is very well written, the plot twist AISUDHFOIUDH. I did get a TINY TINY bit confused but thats kinda my fault coz I kept fast forwading ðŸ˜….</p>
        <p>Definitely recommend if you wanna watch something cute, but also has a very interesting plot. The plot is intense, and gets rly intense near the end, but not AS intense as lighter and princess, maybe a bit like derailment but less intense.</p>
