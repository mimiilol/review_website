    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Not as good as the other dramas in this list, however itâ€™s not bad. It just a simple fluffy romance, and its kinda generic BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT ITS BAD, its just simple. This cdrama is perfect if you just wanna watch something cute and dont want to think too much.</p> 
    <p> I really do like the premise of the show. It is formatted similarly to love H20. At first I really didnâ€™t like how most of the show was the in game scenes, however, Iâ€™ve grown to love it. I didnâ€™t like the fl at all but Iâ€™ve grown to love her. There are a lot of plot holes due to the HORRIBLE EDITING however, it is still a cute romance and I will definitely be rewatching it. OMG AND THE BROTHER AND THE FRIEND HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL, WOULDVE BEEN SUCH A CUTE COUPLE AND ALL THE SIGNS WERE POINTING TO IT, BUT UGH THEM DAM WRITERS. </p>
    <p> TBH it was great in the beginning, but in the later eps it felt like the writer kinda gave up. </p>
