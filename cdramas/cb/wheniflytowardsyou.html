        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>IM NOT KIDDING I LOVE ALLLLLLL OF THE CHARACTERS. At first I couldnâ€™t get use to the ml coz Iâ€™m use to seeing him as aijia in falling into your smile but WHATEVER I GOT OVER IT AND I LOVE HIS CHARACTER. MOST FLUFFY OF FLUFFY ROMANCES BUT ALSO LIKE A SLICE OF LIFE, BUT LIKE, NOT SLICE OF LIFE LIKE GO AHEAD MORE LIKE SLICE OF LIFE INTERGRATED WITHIN ROMANCE. WILL DEF REWATCH. The plot isnâ€™t that intense but it is definitely cute. I also really like the character dynamics. OMG AND ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ARE ALLLLL SOOO CUTE.</p>
        <h2>Rewatch ability</h2>
        <p>SUPER DUPER DUPER REWATCH ABLE since its basically like 99% romance.</p>
