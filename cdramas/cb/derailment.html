        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>LOVE THE GIRLS ACTING, thne dudes meh. Umm not good, but not bad you know what i mean. Coz like the ML gets toxic hella quick. </p>
        <p>ANYWAS, there are things i do like about it, like the plot, OMG AND THE ENDING LOVE THAT, OMG AND I LOVE THE MAKEUP DUDE. Bro i cried a bit too much thrugh out this show. Ok but there arent that many romance scenes, like none that i can remember.</p>
        <p>I would rewatch, but only for the action/drama scenes.</p>
