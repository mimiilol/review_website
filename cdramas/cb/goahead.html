        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>WHOLY CRAP, LOVE IT SOOO MUCH AMAZING TO BING WATCH, I CRIED SOOO MUCH. Tbh it‚Äôs mainly a slice of life and theirs only a few romance scenes, HOWEVER, THIS MAKES THE ROMANCE SCENES EVEN MORE SPECIAL. The plot is beautifully written, it talks about many heavy topics. It isn‚Äôt a fluffy romance AT ALL - be ready to cry 24/7 when watching. There is a lot of funny scenes, however there are also a lot of serious and confronting scenes too.</p>
        <h2>Re-watch ability</h2>
        <p>Tbh this show isnt that re-watch able coz theres only like a few pure romance scenes, BUT THOSE SCENES ARE HELLA CUTE THO. HOWEVER, if you want to cry then this shows HELLA re-watch able</p>
