    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>At first I didnâ€™t really like the fake voice that the FL was using, however I got over it after a while. Unlike falling into your smile, theirs a bit more romance in this one. I donâ€™t really love the second couple, but their not bad - I do skip over their scenes though. The plot isnâ€™t anything big however it is a cute romance to watch. I think the premise of the show is very cute.  However, the drama does get kinda boring at the end and tbh Iâ€™ve kinda forgotten what happens at the end.</p>
    <h2>Rewatch ability</h2>
    <p>Very re-watchable due to how itâ€™s mainly romance.</p>
