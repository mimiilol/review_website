      <h1>Review</h1>
      <p>Im not kidding this drama changed me. Ever since watching this drama I had always watched fluffy light-hearted romances coz thatâ€™s what I though I like the most. BUT THIS DRAMAâ€¦ At first, I really didnâ€™t want to watch it - I hated the editing and production, it felt like a movie (eg. It felt very intense and very different from all the other light hearted romances I like to watch). OMG AND THE CHESMITRY BETWEE THE TWO LEADSðŸ™ˆ </p>
      <p>The story is set as kinda a flashback. The first scene whoâ€™s the ML coming out of prison and the FL coming back from studying abroad. Then it goes to a flashback (the flashback is basically 50% of the show). The flashback shows the FL and ML during collage and is basically a slice of life. The flashback is kinda like a fluffy romance paired with some slice of life kinda things (like issues and problems and fights). The great thing about the story writing is that through the whole flashback scenes I felt the need to keep watching, coz how could such a cute fluffy romance turn into the first scenes that were shown. When you do end up finishing the flashbacks, the show kinda forces you to rewatch the first scenes. When rewatching the first scenes that once felt weird, odd, and confusing it now feels nostalgic kinda and it all makes sense. Its a very hard emotion to explain. Ive leggit never had a drama make me feel these emotions. </p>
      <p>At the end of the drama I just sat theirâ€¦ staring at my screen. Although the amount of episodes is far superior compared to other dramas I never felt bored. I genuinely feel attached to each character. I canâ€™t help but smile during the happy and cry during the sad. The writing, directing, camera work is phenomenal. The plot is so intense and heavy I canâ€™t even start to describe it.</p>
      <p>Although I was a bit confused in parts of the shows, I really did enjoy it AND BRO THE LEADS ARE JUST SO KDSFHLDISFHOPIDSHFJPODFIJ. The fl kinda reminds me of the FL in falling into your smile. PLEASE WATCH IT IM NOT KIDDING.</p>
      <p>This show is SO DAM RE-WATCHABLE, I finished it only a week ago and I've alread re-watched it SOOO MANY TIMES. Theres so many romance scenese AND SAD SCENES ESKUFHOISDUHFOIDSUHF</p>
      <p>HELP APARENTLY PPL DONT LIKE THE SHOW COZ THE DUDES TOXICâ€¦. WELP WHATEVER I THINK HEâ€™S FINE AS HELL.</p>
