    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>I love both leads, their characters are both beautify written. The drama is basically all romance with maybe like 5% not. I also really like the brother character. I don’t really know what to say for it other than that it is so adorable and cute. The plot isn’t intense or anything, but it is beautify written coming of age show. It’s kinda like an older brother drama, similar to exclusive fairy tale.</p>
    <h2>Rewatch ability</h2>
    <p>Probably the most re-watchable drama due to it basically all being romance</p>
