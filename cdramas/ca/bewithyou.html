        <h2>PSS. This isnt a cdrama, it's a variety show</h2>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The variety show focuses on the brother and sister relationship as it records the daily lives of four pair of different siblings. It shows the way they get along with each other and the exploration as they grow up together in order to show the precious kinship of family and the happiness of having a sibling. The show is unique in the way that it comprises of a live panel and the filming of the siblings' daily lives. It mainly focuses on the lives of the siblings to generate unique and interesting topics in life for the audience to discuss about.</p>

        <h2>Re-watch ability</h2>
        <p>10/10 / 4/10</p>
