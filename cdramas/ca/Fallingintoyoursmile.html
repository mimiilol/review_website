        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>First watch: 10/10 <br>Rewatch: 8/10</p>
        <h2>Type of drama</h2>
        <p>Cute romance paired with difficulties of the egame industry. The story revolves around a group called RGDX which has the first ever girl in the e-gaming industry, tong yao.</p>
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>I really enjoy watching this drama every now and then, the friendships never fail to make me smile. The plot isnâ€™t anything that big, itâ€™s just a cute romance to watch whenever your bored, or want something cute and fluffy</p>
        <h2>Rewatch ability</h2>
        <p>PSS. THIS MAY NOT BE FULLY ACCURATE COZ IVE ALREADY RE-WATCHED THIS SHOW 15+ TIMES/gen SO IM A LITTLE BIT SICK OF THE SHOW. (I've litterally memorised like all of the eps....)</p>
        <p>hereâ€™s a lot of romance in the beginning half of the show (before they get together) however after that it decreases. It is basically 40% romance 60% about gaming, I tend to skip over the gaming parts, however, the romance parts are always very cute and very re-watchable.</p>
