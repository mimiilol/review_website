        SOOO GOOD. Made me cry a bit too much. All couples are adorable. Has elements of a fluffy romance however, there is also a mildly intense plot. Its 50% romance 50% about their career. I love the premise and plot of the show. I think it gets more intense during end half of show. I really love it, and I rewatch it every now and then. The character development of everyone is just, mwah PERFECT.
